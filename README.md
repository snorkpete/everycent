Everycent - a Zero Based Budget Manager
=======================================

Everycent is a simple zero-based budgeting tool based around the concept that you give every cent a job. 

You construct a budget that outlines your income for the month, and create allocations to represent how that income is going to be allocated throughout the month (expenses like food and rent, or savings, debt repayment or whatever).

During the month, transactions can be imported from your bank and then allocated against the various expense allocations, showing where your money is being used through the month. On the main budget screen, those expense allocations are summarised per allocation to show you how much you have remaining to use in any given allocation.

At the end of the month, you can copy your budget to create a new budget for the next month, adjust whatever allocations need adjusting for that new month and start again. 

As part of the configuration, you designate one of your accounts as your primary budgeting account, and Everycent provides a helpful summary to help reconcile your budget balances with the account balance in that budgeting account to ensure that you're properly allocating the necessary transactions to the proper budgeting category.

## Credit Cards ##
One particularly tricky issue when dealing with credit cards is how to track the spending properly, since when you buy something with a credit card, it's actually not paid for until some time after. Everycent has a concept of 'paid' vs 'unpaid' transactions. Transactions against credit card accounts are defaulted as 'unpaid' transactions. Therefore, when you make a purchase with a credit card, you can put an allocation towards that transaction at the time of the purchase. This transaction will default as 'unpaid', but when you view your budget, the money spent against that allocation will include these 'unpaid' transactions. 

Later on, when you make a payment on your credit card to pay off the outstanding balance, you can go back and mark the previous transactions as 'paid' to indicate that they have been handled. When viewing credit card transaction data, there's a helpful 'unpaid' total to show you what money you have already spent but not paid for to ensure that you're tracking your spending properly. 

## Sink Funds ##
In Dave Ramsey terminology, a sink fund is simply a category of money that is being built up to be used for a specific purpose. Everycent allows any account to be marked as a sink fund account. At this point, the money in the account can be allocated for each purpose and expenses against this purpose tracked separately even though the funds are actually in the same bank account.


### History ###
Everycent was developed after my wife and I started listening to Dave Ramsey and realised we needed to get our finances in order. We changed how we handled our finances and moved to using one shared account for all household spending, and keeping our personal accounts only for our own personal discretionary expenses. Everything else is allocated in the budget and tracked against those budget allocations so we can see how our household spending goes through the month.
