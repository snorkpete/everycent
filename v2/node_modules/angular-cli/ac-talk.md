Good morning everyone,

In the early days of Angular 1 we payed a lot of attention to making sure that Angular 1 was not only easy to use, but also easy to get started with. We want the same to be true for Angular 2.

If you have tried using some of the language features like ES6 and TypeScript already, you probably bumped into various issues integrating all the tools to get things working just right.

But it's not just about the new language features, even with ES5 there is still a lot of repetetive work and boilerplate code one needs to write just to get a real project up and running.

In Angular 2 we are going to address these problems with a set of tools that make the whole experience seemless.

We are still in early stages, but through a collaboration with our friends from ember-cli, we put together this proof of concept for what this experience could look like. Let me show you.

To start you install `angular-cli` via npm. I've done that already, so I'll skip this step.

$ npm install -g angular-cli

Next I'll kick of project generation via the `ng` command:

$ ng new hello-ac

This command will do several things. First it will create a new directory, generate essential files like package.json, index.html and more, install all necessary npm packages (like angular2).

Currently the templates used to generate the new project are typescript specific, and the project is preconfigured with everything necessary to author your application in typescript including all the typing information available in angular's d.ts files, source map support and more.

Now that the project is ready, all I need to do is start the development server and open my editor.

$ cd hello-ac
$ ng serve

And I can hack on the code, save and see the result of my changes in the browser. Including any errors.

And once I'm ready to share the project with others, it shouldn't be a joyful event, not something I'm dreading because of all the steps involved. But most of these steps can be automated. This is just a simple app, doesn't require any backend or custom domain, so let's deploy it as a github page.

$ ng github-pages:deploy

I'm being asked for github username and password. Once I enter those, a new github repository is created for me. The application is built the built artifacts are committed into a special branch that is then pushed to GitHub where GitHub picks it up and makes it available to everyone.

It really should be this easy to get started with Angular 2 and share your apps or components with others.

This project is available on github under github.com/angular/angular-cli and while useful for exploration of Angular 2 it is far from addressing all of the workflows and considerations necessary for real apps. The good news is that now that Angualar 2 core is stabilizing, we can dive in and start working on these. If you are passionate about tooling and have , get in touch with me
