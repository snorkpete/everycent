/**
 * Stabilizes the inputPath for the following plugins in the build tree.
 *
 * All broccoli plugins that inherit from `broccoli-writer` or `broccoli-filter` change their
 * outputPath during each rebuild.
 *
 * This means that all following plugins in the build tree can't rely on their inputPath being
 * immutable. This results in breakage of any plugin that is not expecting such behavior.
 *
 * For example all `DiffingBroccoliPlugin`s expect their inputPath to be stable.
 *
 * By inserting this plugin into the tree after any misbehaving plugin, we can stabilize the
 * inputPath for the following plugin in the tree and correct the surprising behavior.
