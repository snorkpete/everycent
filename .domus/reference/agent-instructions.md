# Domus — Workflow Instructions

## Before creating a task

Always check the existing task list before creating a new task. Run `domus task list` or scan `.domus/tasks/` to avoid duplicates — including cancelled tasks, which may be worth reopening rather than recreating.

## Task file editing rules

Task markdown files have two distinct parts — use the right tool for each:

- **Metadata fields** (frontmatter: status, autonomous, priority, depends-on, etc.) — always update via `domus task update <id> --field value`. This keeps `tasks.jsonl` in sync. Direct file edits to frontmatter will silently diverge from the index and break `domus task overview` and other commands.
- **Status transitions** — use `domus task advance <id>` for normal forward progression. Use `domus task cancel`, `domus task defer`, `domus task reopen` for escape hatches. `domus task status` is a Doctor power tool only.
- **Body content** (description, acceptance criteria, implementation notes) — edit the markdown file directly with Write/Edit tools. The CLI has no flags for body content.

## Task status lifecycle

```
raw → proposed → ready → in-progress → done
```

- **raw** (`○`) — just captured, needs refinement
- **proposed** (`◐`) — Claude has done a refinement pass (criteria written, shape clear) but the human hasn't reviewed yet
- **ready** (`◎`) — human approved, waiting for dispatch
- **in-progress** (`◑`) — being worked on
- **done** (`●`) — complete

Escape hatches from any state: `cancelled` (`✕`), `deferred` (`⏸`). Re-entry: `reopen` returns to `raw`.

`ready-for-senior-review` (`⊙`) exists in the state engine but is skipped by `advance` in v0.0. Known v0.1 addition.

### The `autonomous` flag

Boolean on each task, always present in frontmatter (`**Autonomous:** true` or `**Autonomous:** false`). Controls whether the task can be dispatched to a Worker for autonomous execution. Set via `domus task update <id> --autonomous` or `--no-autonomous`.

### CLI commands for status transitions

- `domus task advance <id>` — primary forward transition. The state engine decides the next status.
- `domus task cancel <id> [--note <text>]` — cancel from any active state
- `domus task defer <id> [--note <text>]` — defer from any active state
- `domus task reopen <id>` — reopen cancelled/deferred → raw
- `domus task status <id> <value>` — Doctor power tool only, not for normal workflow. Only use this when fixing data consistency issues (e.g. a task stuck in the wrong status). All normal workflow goes through the commands above.

### The `--root` flag

When running in a worktree or targeting a different project's store, use `--root <path>` on all domus commands. Never set the `DOMUS_ROOT` environment variable directly — it is an internal mechanism used by `cli.ts` after parsing `--root`.

```
domus --root /path/to/main-repo task log <id> "message"
```

## Task overview grouping

Overview groups tasks by status in this order:
1. **Ready** — can be dispatched
2. **In Progress** — currently being worked on
3. **Proposed** — needs human review
4. **Raw** — needs refinement
5. **Blocked** — unmet dependencies

**`task add` and `task update` flags must mirror each other.** When a flag is added to one command, add it to the other in the same commit.

**Superseded tasks must be cancelled immediately.** If a task is superseded by another piece of work, cancel it (`domus task cancel <id> --note "reason"`) at the same time as writing any outcome note.

## Ideas vs tasks

An **idea** is for exploring unknowns — "is this worth pursuing?" or "what are we even talking about?" Ideas are concepts under development. A task forms from an idea once it's clear something will be implemented.

A **task** is for known implementation work. Even if details need refinement, the direction is decided.

When in doubt: if you don't know whether something will be built, it's an idea. If you know it will, it's a task.
