  "readme": "# gulp-uglifyjs [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]\n\n> Minify multiple JavaScript with UglifyJS2.\n\nThis plugin is based off of [gulp-uglify](https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify)\nbut allows you to directly use all of Uglify's options. The main difference\nbetween these two plugins is that passing in an array of files (or glob pattern\nthat matches multiple files) will pass that array directly to Uglify. Uglify\nwill handle both concatenating and minifying those files.\n\nLetting Uglify handle the concatenation and minification allows for the\ngenerated source map to be able to separate the files in the browser for easier\ndebugging, and it avoids the intermediate step of `concat()`. Using `concat()`\nand then `uglify()` would result in a source map for the already concatenated\nfile which has the possibility of being quite large, making it hard to find the\ncode you are wanting to debug.\n\nNOTE: This plugin has been blacklisted as it relies on Uglify to concat the files\ninstead of using `gulp.concat` which breaks the \"It should do one thing\" paradigm.\nWhen I created this plugin, there was no way to get source maps to work with gulp,\nhowever now there is a \"gulp-sourcemaps\" plugin that achieves the same goal.\ngulp-uglifyjs still works great and gives very granular control over the Uglify\nexecution, I'm just giving you a heads up that other options exist now.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar uglify = require('gulp-uglifyjs');\n\ngulp.task('uglify', function() {\n  gulp.src('public/js/*.js')\n    .pipe(uglify())\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/js'))\n});\n```\n\nThis will concatenate and minify all files found by `public/js/*.js` and write\nit to a file with the same name as the first file found.\n\n## API\n\n`uglify([filename], [options])`\n\n- filename - optional\n\n  Override the default output filename.\n\n- options - optional\n\n  These options are directly passed to Uglify. Below are some examples of what\n  is available. To see a full list, read UglifyJS's [documentation](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/#api-reference)\n\n  - `outSourceMap`\n\n    (default `false`) Give a `string` to be the name of the source map. Set to\n    `true` and the source map name will be the same as the output file name\n    suffixed with `.map`.\n\n    Note: if you would like your source map to point to relative paths instead\n    of absolute paths (which you probably will if it is hosted on a server), set\n    the `basePath` option to be the base of where the content is served.\n\n  - `inSourceMap`\n\n    If you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\n    can use the inSourceMap argument. This can only be used in conjunction with\n    `outSourceMap`.\n\n  - `sourceRoot`\n\n    Sets the root location for where the source files should be found\n\n  - `mangle`\n\n    (default `{}`) Set to `false` to skip mangling names. See [options](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/blob/e37b67d013c4537a36bb3c24f4f99e72efbf6d4b/lib/scope.js#L328) for possible key/value pairs.\n\n  - `output`\n\n    (default `null`) Pass an Object if you wish to specify additional [output options](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen).\n    The defaults are optimized for best compression.\n\n  - `compress`\n\n    (default `{}`) Pass an Object to specify custom [compressor options](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress).\n    Pass `false` to skip compression completely.\n\n  - `enclose`\n\n    (default `undefined`) Pass an Object to wrap all of the code in a closure\n    with a configurable arguments/parameters list. Each key-value pair in the\n    enclose object is effectively an argument-parameter pair.\n\n  - `wrap`\n\n    (default `undefined`) Pass a String to wrap all of the code in a closure.\n    This is an easy way to make sure nothing is leaking. Variables that need to\n    be public `exports` and `global` are made available. The value of wrap is\n    the global variable exports will be available as.\n\n  - `exportAll`\n\n    (default `false`) Set to `true` to ake all global functions and variables\n    available via the `export` variable. Only available when using `wrap`.\n\n### Examples\n\nTo minify multiple files into a 'app.min.js' and create a source map:\n\n```js\ngulp.task('uglify', function() {\n  gulp.src('public/js/*.js')\n    .pipe(uglify('app.min.js', {\n      outSourceMap: true\n    }))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/js'))\n});\n```\n\nTo minify multiple files from different paths to 'app.js', but skip mangling\nand beautify the results:\n\n```js\ngulp.task('uglify', function() {\n  gulp.src(['public/js/*.js', 'bower_components/**/*.js'])\n    .pipe(uglify('app.js', {\n      mangle: false,\n      output: {\n        beautify: true\n      }\n    }))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/js'))\n});\n```\n\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/gulp-uglifyjs.svg\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-uglifyjs/\n\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/gulp-uglifyjs.svg\n\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/craigjennings11/gulp-uglifyjs\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/craigjennings11/gulp-uglifyjs.svg?branch=master\n",
